           <p>Asthma is a chronic disease of the airways that makes breathing difficult. With asthma, there is inflammation of the air passages that results in a temporary narrowing of the airways that carry oxygen to the lungs. This results in asthma symptoms, including coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness.</p>

    <h3>Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>    
<p>To diagnose asthma, your doctor will discuss your medical history with you and perform a physical exam. You may need a lung function test and maybe other tests, such as a chest or sinus X-ray.</p>
            
 <p>For Treatment there are two main types of medications used to treat asthma:
Long-term control medications such as inhaled corticosteroids are the most important medications used to keep asthma under control. ...
Quick-relief inhalers contain a fast-acting medication such as albuterol (Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA).</p>

       <h3>pulmonary embolism</h3>
     <img src="images/AdobeStock_95473695.jpeg">    
     <p>When a blood clot gets caught in one of the arteries that go from the heart to the lungs, it's called a pulmonary embolism (PE). ... If the clot is big or the artery is clogged by many smaller clots, a pulmonary embolism can be fatal. Pulmonary embolisms usually travel to the lungs from a deep vein in the legs.</p>
    <p>How Do Doctors Diagnose a Pulmonary Embolism?</p>
    <p>He’ll look closely at your legs to see if they’re swollen, tender, discolored, or warm. These are signs that you may have a clot deep in one of your veins.</p>
  
    <p>your doctor may order a number of tests, like a chest X-ray or ultrasound. You might also have blood tests. These can measure the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood. They can also help your doctor detect a substance called D dimer. This is a small protein fragment that’s present in the blood after a clot is broken down by the body.</p>
