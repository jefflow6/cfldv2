<ul>    
<li><strong>Obstructive sleep apnea</strong> is a serious sleep disorder that occurs when a person's breathing is interrupted during sleep.This type of apnea occurs when your throat muscles intermittently relax and block your airway during sleep. A noticeable sign of obstructive sleep apnea is snoring.</li>
<li><strong>Insomnia</strong> is a sleep disorder that is characterized by difficulty falling and/or staying asleep. People with insomnia have one or more of the following symptoms: Difficulty falling asleep. Waking up often during the night and having trouble going back to sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Narcolepsy</strong> is a neurological disorder that affects the control of sleep and wakefulness. People with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness and intermittent, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the daytime. These sudden sleep attacks may occur during any type of activity at any time of the day.</li>
<li><strong>Restless legs syndrome</strong> (RLS), also called Willis-Ekbom Disease, causes unpleasant or uncomfortable sensations in the legs and an irresistible urge to move them. Symptoms commonly occur in the late afternoon or evening hours, and are often most severe at night when a person is resting, such as sitting or lying in bed.</li>

    <h3 class="hak-h3">Treatments for Sleep Disorders</h3>    
       <ul>
           
        <li><strong>Overnight sleep study</strong> first be diagnosed at a sleep center or lab during an overnight sleep study, or “polysomnogram.” The sleep study charts vital signs such as brain waves, heart beat and breathing.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)</strong>
    CPAP is the standard treatment option for moderate to severe cases of OSA and a good option for mild sleep apnea. CPAP provides a steady stream of pressurized air to patients through a mask that they wear during sleep. This airflow keeps the airway open, preventing pauses inbreathing and restoring normal oxygen levels. Newer CPAP models are small, light and virtually silent. Patients can choose from numerous mask sizes and styles to achieve a good fit. Heated humidifiers that connect to CPAP units contribute to patient comfort. </li>
<li><strong>Oral Appliances</strong>
    An oral appliance is an effective treatment option for people with mild to moderateOSA who either prefer it to CPAP or are unable to successfully comply with CPAP therapy. Oral appliances look much like sports mouth guards, and they help maintain an open and unobstructed airway by repositioning or stabilizing the lower jaw, tongue, soft palate or uvula. Some are designed specifically for snoring, and others are intended to treat both snoring and sleep apnea. </li>
